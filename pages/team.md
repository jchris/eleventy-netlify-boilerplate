### J Chris Anderson
Founder

Chris' interest in distributed computing dates back to the early 90s, when he engaged with early local BBS store-and-forward systems in Austin, Texas. In 2009, as a key player in the NoSQL movement, Chris contributed to Apache CouchDB, where he developed one of the first JavaScript Serverless APIs. This work established the foundation for Fireproof's cloudless computing approach, stemming from Chris's expertise in peer-to-peer data synchronization and serverless computing.

With a notable record of startup achievements, Chris has extensive experience in various roles. He has founded companies, led engineering teams, and worked with clients to deliver inventive solutions. As Couchbase's ($BASE) co-founder, Chris designed Couchbase Mobile, a differentiator that secured valuable business cases such as United Airlines in-flight service and crew scheduling. Building technology that became mission-critical for front-line business processes like payments at Walmart and Apple, he gained an appreciation for the commercial relationships that buyers seek. Equipped with serverless integration knowledge from his time at FaunaDB, a multi-cloud transactional database, and client service skills developed at McKinsey & Company, Chris is well-prepared to navigate the complexities of both technology development and market strategy for Fireproof.

Chris seizes opportunities at the right moment, and thrives on building successful ventures from scratch. With a core philosophy centered on shifting the power dynamics of the web and returning control to users, he co-founded Couchbase and revolutionized the mobile database industry. Now, as the founder of Fireproof, Chris employs his extensive expertise to develop cutting-edge real-time database technology with the potential for deep impact on the industry. Drawing from a wealth of experience across multiple successful projects, Chris' proven track record and adaptability in the face of evolving technology trends distinguishes Fireproof among databases.
